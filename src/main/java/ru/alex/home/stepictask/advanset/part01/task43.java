/**
 * A detector compares the size of parts produced by a machine with the reference standard.
 * If the size of the part is larger, it can be sent to be fixed, and the detector prints the number 1.
 * If the size of the part is smaller, it is removed as reject, and the detector prints the number -1.
 * If the part was made perfect, it is sent to the box with ready products, and the detector prints 0.
 * Write a program, which takes the number of parts n as input, and then the sequence of detector prints.
 * The program should output numbers in a single line â€“ the number of ready parts,
 * the number of parts to be fixed, and the number of rejects.
